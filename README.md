customer segmentation
Gender Distribution: Analyzing the gender distribution can reveal if there is a balance or skew towards a particular gender. This can inform targeted marketing strategies.

Insight: If one gender is predominant, special promotions can be designed to attract the less represented gender.

Age Analysis: Understanding the age distribution helps in identifying the age groups that frequent the mall the most.

Insight: If a particular age group, like young adults, constitutes the majority, the mall can cater its offerings towards their preferences, such as trendy fashion stores or tech gadgets.

Income Segmentation: Segmenting customers by their annual income helps in understanding the spending capacity of different segments.

Insight: High-income customers might prefer premium brands and exclusive services, while those with lower incomes might be more attracted to discounts and budget-friendly options.

Spending Behavior: The Spending Score indicates how much a customer spends. Analyzing this can identify high-value customers.

Insight: Customers with high spending scores can be targeted with loyalty programs and personalized offers to retain them.

Correlation Analysis:

Income vs Spending Score: Investigating the correlation between annual income and spending score can reveal if higher income leads to higher spending.

Insight: A strong positive correlation would suggest that as income increases, spending also increases, guiding the mall to focus on affluent customers.

Age vs Spending Score: Understanding how spending varies with age can help tailor marketing efforts accordingly.

Insight: If younger customers tend to have higher spending scores, the mall can focus on activities and stores that appeal to the younger demographic.
